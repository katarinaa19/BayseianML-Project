## **🌟1. Overview**  

### **🎯Objective**  
The objective of this project is to develop an Image Captioning model that can generate accurate and meaningful textual descriptions for images. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for text generation, the model aims to:
- **Process Textual and Visual Data**: Tokenize and preprocess captions to create a structured vocabulary for training, while simultaneously extracting image features using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., DenseNet201) to encode visual content into feature vectors.  
- **Train a Sequence-to-Sequence Model**: Combine CNN-extracted features with LSTM-based text generation to predict the next word in a caption.
- **Generate Captions for New Images**: Use the trained model to describe unseen images with relevant and coherent text.

### **📂Dataset**  
- **Data Description**: The Flickr8k Dataset consists of 8,091 images, each paired with five unique textual descriptions, totaling 40,455 captions. It is specifically designed for training and evaluating models that generate natural language descriptions for images.
- **Images:** 8,091 natural scene images.
- **Captions per image:** Each image has 5 corresponding descriptions.

### **📌 Step 1: Data Preprocessing**  
- [Brief explanation of preprocessing]  

### **📌 Step 2: Encode**  
#### 2.1 Image Feature Encoding
- Extract image features using DenseNet201 to convert images into meaningful numerical vectors.  
- Reduce dimensionality using `Dense(256)` to ensure a compact representation of the image.  
- Convert features to 3D using `RepeatVector(max_caption_length-1)`: (256,) → (max_caption_length-1, 256)
  - This ensures image features align with textual input sequences.  

#### 2.2 Text Feature Encoding
- Convert words into vector representations using an `Embedding` layer.  
- Transform text into 3D format, which is required for sequential processing in LSTM.  

#### 2.3 Merge & Caption Generation  
- Two-step merging process:  
  1. `Add()` merges visual and textual features.  
  2. LSTM processes the combined sequence, learning relationships between image content and text.  

#### 2.4 Caption Generation with LSTM
- LSTM generates the caption word by word, predicting the next word based on the image and previous words.  
- Softmax selects the most probable word, ensuring meaningful sentence formation.  

#### 2.5 Model Refinement
- Use two `Dense` layers to extract key features and improve accuracy.  
- Apply a Softmax layer to select the most probable word from the vocabulary.  
- Use Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
